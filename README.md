# Human-Assistive-Glove-project
Final Year Project -Smart Glove for Sign Language Translation and Gesture Controlled Home Automation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to help speech-impaired and differently-abled people communicate with normal people using hand gestures. A wearable smart glove is used to detect hand movements and translate them into meaningful text and speech. The same glove can also be used to control home appliances like fan and light using hand gestures.
The smart glove is integrated with sensors and microcontrollers to detect motion and identify different gesture patterns.
## 🔧 Hardware Components Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- ADXL345 Accelerometer Sensor
- DFPlayer Mini + Speaker
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- Relay Module
- Smart Glove
- Jumper Wires
- Battery / Power supply
## 💻 Software Tools Used
- Arduino IDE
- GitHub
- Embedded C / Arduino Programming
## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The accelerometer detects hand motion in X, Y, Z axes.
2. Different acceleration ranges trigger different commands.
3. According to detected gesture:
   - Light ON / OFF
   - Fan ON / OFF
   - Emergency message
   - Hungry, Hello, Help messages
4. Output is shown on LCD and announced using speaker.
5. Relays control the connected electrical appliances.
